            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>‘Human Sightings’ is a small, independent, art platform set up by myself in 2017. Throughout my life I’ve
                used art to cope with my own mental health struggles, as well as a way to explore gender identity.</p>
            <p>I decided to start sharing my artwork a few years ago, and it’s been really amazing to see how many
                people can identify with the cynical aliens and slightly morbid but encouraging astronauts!</p>
            <p>It makes my day every time I get a lovely message from someone about a badge they wear, or a postcard
                they’ve stuck on their wall!</p>
            <p>It’s definitely made me feel less alone</p>
