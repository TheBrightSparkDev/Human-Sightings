# Human Sightings

Human Sightings is a site for people to come and take a look at some comics and potentially follow a link to purchase some products
the site is also there to introduce poeple to the wonderful art of Evelyn Basch. It's designed to replace the previous site they had
and incorporate her style into everything, from headers to backgrounds it's all space themed and fun. Users of the site will already be fans of Evelyns or potential new fans.

## Features 

### The best bits

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all the main pages the navigation bar is the first evelyn themed art you'll see three glorious moons with one of them being eclipsed slightly to show what page you are currently on.
  - This will allow users to go from page to page easily and know what page they are currently on

- __About us section__

  -  Since the page is all about introducing people to Evie this is where they can add information about themselves and who they are.
  -  Users will be brought in by this section and start to learn more about them 

![About us]

- __Comics section__

  - This is the first opportunity for users to be introduced to the wonderful aliens that Evie is known for drawing. These will be introduced as clickable links to take users to the comic pages. There are in total 9 comics but only the first 3 are shown here with an option to view more which links to the comics page. 
  - Not only will the user start to learn about the characters and their deep emotional thoughts they will hopefully relate to some and later on that may drive them to buy some of the products that displays some of the funny or deep quotes that lie within the comics.

- __Shop__

  - This is the first opportunity for users to be redirected to the etsy site where purchases can be made for the products hopefully they would've seen the comics first and known some backstories behind the products.
  - This section is where the user can go if they want to support the creator and purchase some items the creator hand- manufactures

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer contains links to many of the artists different social sites from facebook to instagram and even an etsy link too. 
  - The footer is a visual indicator to users that the page is finished and that they can click into any of the links to get to know the artist more.

- __Comics Page__

  - The comics page is all about comics and meeting the various character and laughing or crying with them as they go through some of the
  toughest subjects and whackiest scenarios
  - This section is all about users having a look around they are more than welcome to click on any comic and with the template its always going to be easy to add more.

- __Shop__

  - This page is the end goal of the website to get users to fall in love with the comics and potentially follow one of the links to the 
  various products on offer on Evies site with a little teaser to say there's plenty more where that came from at the end of the page.

### Features Left to Implement

- The comics page is free to be expanded on whenever a new comic becomes available 

- The shop page is also expandable as there are always more products being added

- Potentially add additional pages for each product to give a better description into what they are

- Opportunity in the future to take purchases directly on the site to increase profits per item and avoid etsy cut

- opportunity to also add a log when I'm able to use Javascript to make it easy for the creator to create additional pages

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

The individual comics page can be quite hard to implement AND make responsive so adding new pages may prove time consuing in the future I look to create a few templates to the artist can easily add her own in the future rather than contacting me to add them everytime. 

## Deployment

I was using github as the repository for the whole project so when I wanted to create a live page it was very easy to do.

I did however have trouble with relative vs absolute links as I found I had accidentally used alot of absolute which meant the page was broken when uploaded. Was a simple fix!

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. 

The live link can be found here - https://thebrightsparkdev.github.io/Human-Sightings/
